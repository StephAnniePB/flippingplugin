          <h1>–Steph's Tech Adventure–</h1>
          <p>
            06/19/2015 Welcome to my tech adventure! I am a writer so the thing that drew me to this class was the opportunity to learn how to create a website to house my writing in the form of short stories, poems, and a memoir. I have never been exposed to coding before and though I know my way around Word, Excel, Adobe etc. I was eager to see if I can build a career around the brains of the internet. I am never one to back down from a challenge and after completing the first week of this academy I feel as if I can be successful. Today, I was able to follow a set of directions completely on my own. It was a great confidence boost to sit down on my MacBook and create a github. I am eager to see where this journey will take me. I want to be able to create websites that are easy for the public to navigate and that draw you into the organizations you are researching. I have an interest in grant writing and fundraising so I think a lot about how to draw the public into different causes. It is very difficult for me as a grant writer to tell a potential donor to look at our website if it is not "people friendly". This is a passion and I am very excited to see what tools I can use to combat this problem and also I want a spring board into freedom. I want the freedom to live in a safe neighborhood, to afford an organic diet and to be able to afford proper medical care. I think that these needs must be met so that I can be my best self.

          <h1>–Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire–</h1>
          <p> Yesterday I learned some new things that I can add to my tech bag and I was reminded of some old favorites. The academy reminded me of Google Docs. I am still working on learning my way around this feature being that I am old school. Meaning I like carrying flash drives around on my key chain.  I learned about Trello and Harvest. I learned about Slacker and played around with my Mac AirBook. I really like that we use Mac in class because it gives me an opportunity to familiarize myself with the system and build a new skill. 
          The opportunity to learn new skills is what attracted me to this program. Yesterday Lupus reared its ugly head and I had to leave class early.  I think that I will have to develop a new self-care plan so that I can make it through this class.

         <h1>-Entering the World of JS-</h1>
          <p> 06/26/2015 This week we dived into the bright yellow world of JS. I was excited to gain a deeper understanding of the book that sat on my nightstand surrounded by my beloved fiction. I had opened it before Monday; but on Monday the language shifted from heiroglyphics to english. I love that I had taken Logic classes as a student because it made working with Chapter 1 a review. Feeling this way about Chapter 1 made it easier to seek out the challenge of code school. I discovered code school when my teacher sent me an invite through gmail. I like the program and it is teaching me a lot. I am excited to use it but sometimes I wish I had more examples of how things should be done. This weekend I am going to start reading chapter two and see if I can work on code school some more.

          <h1>–Many Ways to Solve a Puzzle–</h1>
          <p>07/03/2015 This past week we dove deeper into the yellow world of JS as we began working on worksheet two. During the time I spent examining the problems within this worksheet I kept hearing the old adage "There are many ways to skin a cat"; I try not to wonder when skinning cats was a thing and instead focus on the realization that there are many ways to solve a puzzle. I like that my answers do not match my classmates. I like the uniqueness and individuality found in the truth that there are many ways to solve a puzzle. I also like that my classmates can help me reach my answers although theirs are different than mine. I am eager to experience week four.

          <h1>–Getting Git-</h1>
          <p>07/17/2015 This week I decided to make the courses on code school for Git my friend. I want to be comfortable with it because it is used by programmers in the real world as we saw today at Driffty. I am getting used to it and I was even able to help some of my classmates figure some things out while our instructors were busy helping someone else. I like code school because I can work there when I get ahead in class. I also like it because I can go at my own pace. At first I had some difficulty because I was not used to the format and the way the program corrects you reminded me of the way my Spanish program tells me to pay attention; however now I am okay with it. Learning Git has helped me work out my fears about whether this is the right path for me. The more badges I earn in code school the more I realize that I can do this. I am really looking forward to building my website, establishing a web presence and building my business. Yay for getting Git!
